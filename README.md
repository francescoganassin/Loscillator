# Loscillator
This is a project of an instrument for a theatre reading of a text by Dino Buzzati. 

Originally it should be a sort of drone machine for relaxed cello impro lines, but it could be used also as a standalone  

Loscillator stands for my pleasure in listening Loscil's music and the blendings of different oscillators similar to an organo portativo  

It should implement an MPU6050 as a controller, changing the sound and the color of the timbre depending on the position of the box  

It comes in two different version, basic, even with some extra sounds and let's say extended  

Based on Mozzi examples by Tim Barrass 
Works with Leonardo Micro Pro, MozziByte and MPU6050
